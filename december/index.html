<p>December marks the final issue of <em>1923</em> , which of course brought to mind the sense of endings. The cover is a literal approach, taken from the November, 1923 issue of the horror fiction pulp magazine, <em>Weird Tales</em>. The body of the zine is something else entirely: a selection of poems from <a href="https://archive.org/details/bodyofthisdeathp01boga"><em>Body of This Death</em></a>, the first collection of poetry by Louise Bogan.  </p>

<p>Bogan <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/louise-bogan">achieved fame as a poet</a> and as the poetry critic for the New Yorker, a role she served in for 38 years. She died almost exactly fifty years ago to the day. The day after her death, the <em>New York Times</em> ran a long obituary, which featured this quote I found inspiring:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's silly to suggest the writing of poetry as something ethereal, a sort of soul‚Äêcrashing, devastating emotional experience that wrings you. I have no fancy idea about poetry. It's not like embroidery or painting or silk. It doesn't come to you on the wings of a dove. It's some thing you have to work hard at.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Body of This Death</em> was considered a "major work," and poems from this collection were included in many of the collections that followed. For this zine, I've selected a handful of the poems, and rearranged their order.</p>

<p>The music in the center is from an Irving Berlin composition, <a href="https://archive.org/details/78_waltz-of-long-ago_emerson-dance-orch-irving-berlin_gbia0040333b">Waltz of Long Ago</a>.</p>
