# December

December marks the final issue of _1923_ , which of course brought to mind the sense of endings. The cover is a literal approach, taken from the November, 1923 issue of the horror fiction pulp magazine, _Weird Tales_. The body of the zine is something else entirely: a selection of poems from [_Body of This Death_](https://archive.org/details/bodyofthisdeathp01boga), the first collection of poetry by Louise Bogan.  
  
Bogan [achieved fame as a poet](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/louise-bogan) and as the poetry critic for the New Yorker, a role she served in for 38 years. She died almost exactly fifty years ago to the day. The day after her death, the _New York Times_ ran a long obituary, which featured this quote I found inspiring:

> It's silly to suggest the writing of poetry as something ethereal, a sort of soul‐crashing, devastating emotional experience that wrings you. I have no fancy idea about poetry. It's not like embroidery or painting or silk. It doesn't come to you on the wings of a dove. It's some thing you have to work hard at.

 _Body of This Death_ was considered a "major work," and poems from this collection were included in many of the collections that followed. For this zine, I've selected a handful of the poems, and rearranged their order.

The music in the center is from an Irving Berlin composition, [Waltz of Long Ago](https://archive.org/details/78_waltz-of-long-ago_emerson-dance-orch-irving-berlin_gbia0040333b).

As usual, the images on this page are all the pages of the zine, arranged “2-up” like the actual printed copy. You can click any page to view it larger, and use the arrow keys to navigate.

For those of you interested in the PDFs, I’ve got the now standard two formats:

  * The full [December _1923_ issue](/s/1923_issue12.pdf), page by page

  * The same issue [laid out for double-sided print jobs](/s/1923_issue12_arranged.pdf), where each zine page is a quarter of a US Letter page. This PDF, printed, can be used to produce two copies of the zine.
