# January

The January issue of _1923_ features excerpts from _Birds of California_ , the last major book by [noted ornithologist William Leon Dawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Leon_Dawson). (His earlier titles include _Birds of Ohio_ and _Birds of Washington_.) It’s a strange book, and I’ve tried to capture some of that strangeness in the excerpts. The Internet Archive hosts [a scanned version of the deluxe first edition](https://archive.org/details/birdsofcaliforni01daws) that was released to an “approved clientele of 250” patrons.

If you just want beautiful bird illustrations from 1923, you might do better with _Birds of America_ by T. Gilbert Pearson, also [available in its entirety on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/birdsofamerica01pear). That volume is the source of the beautiful egg drawings that grace the cover of this edition and [the Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/887675031/1923-a-monthly-zine-of-public-domain-treasures)—I found them before I found Dawson’s work and I was too attached to them to use anything else.

But I selected _Birds of California_ for its idiosyncratic style. Dawson is a man obsessed with birds, and that obsession is (usually) infectious. Where readers might have expected a dry textbook-ish approach, they instead got a strange and incredibly detailed paean to avian kind.

And honestly, I couldn’t express that better than Dawson does in the excerpt I selected for the opening page. It works as a bit of an introduction to his philosophy and—I hope—to mine with this zine project. There is beauty and wonder in the archive! But you must open yourself up to seeing it.

Anyway, down to business: the images on this page are all the pages of the zine, arranged “2-up” like the actual printed copy. You can click any page to view it larger, and use the arrow keys to navigate.

If you’d like to view them as a PDF, I’ve prepared two formats and will continue to do so for future issues:

  * [The full _1923: January_ issue](/s/1923_issue01.pdf), page-by-page

  * [The same issue, laid out for double-sided print jobs](/s/1923_issue01_arranged.pdf). I’ve preserved one formatting quirk that I used in production: namely, the cover is doubled on the first page and the second page is blank. I printed the cover in color on heavier paper, so it made sense to separate it out and get twice as much use out of a single page.




This page will remain locked for subscribers for an initial period, and then I will open it up to the public.
