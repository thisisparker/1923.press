This month’s _1923_ is a full short story, front to back: “Milk Bottles,” by Sherwood Anderson. Anderson had rocketed to fame four years earlier with the short story cycle _Winesburg, Ohio_ , and published somewhat prolifically throughout the early 1920s. _Horses and Men_ , the story collection which includes “Milk Bottles,” was one of two books he put out in 1923. [It’s available in full](https://books.google.com/books?id=0mMyAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) from Google Books.

The image on the front cover is a portrait of Anderson shot by the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, a photographer and modern art promoter married to Georgia O’Keeffe. Anderson was friends with the couple; [a letter he wrote to Stieglitz](http://theamericanreader.com/30-june-1923-sherwood-anderson-to-alfred-stieglitz/) just before the publication of _Horses and Men_ is available online. The Art Institute of Chicago holds [the cover image](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66368/sherwood-anderson) and others, and a [whole Stieglitz collection](http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz/).

For some levity, I included images from a USDA publication called “[Educational milk-for-health campaigns](https://archive.org/details/educationalmilkf250hoov/page/n1).” Because it’s a government publication, it would have been in the public domain from its creation—so, not completely on brand for this publication—but I found it interesting and compelling and it was a surprising source of information about the cultural significance of milk at the time Anderson was writing.
