# October

The October issue of _1923_ is made up, appropriately, of costume drawings by Will R. Barnes, the costume designer at New York’s [Hippodrome theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Hippodrome). The Hippodrome was the largest and best-known theater in the city, famous for its spectacular shows and, later, musicals featuring hundreds of performers.

From 1908 to 1923, the showman R. H. Burnside was the artistic director at the Hippodrome, responsible for these performances. During 1923, they staged a show called _Better Times_ (the follow-up to the wildly successful _Good Times_ ), and one called _Stepping Stones_. The costume design cards from those two shows make up the illustrations in this zine.

These images are just a handful of the [hundreds of drawings by Will Barnes](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/r-h-burnside-collection-2#/?tab=navigation&roots=75bb5ab0-79b7-0137-3545-29e6f5ea9735/81f0f400-79b7-0137-d0b0-023161837896) and in [the R. H. Burnside collection](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/r-h-burnside-collection-2#/?tab=navigation) held at the New York Public Library. It is quite a remarkable collection, and bears looking through!

As usual, the images on this page are all the pages of the zine, arranged “2-up” like the actual printed copy. You can click any page to view it larger, and use the arrow keys to navigate.

For this round of PDFs, I actually have a new format, and I plan to go back and replace earlier formats with these. I think the second one should be a little easier to assemble.

  * The full [October _1923_ issue](/s/1923_issue10.pdf), page by page

  * The same issue [laid out for double-sided print jobs](/s/1923_issue10_arranged.pdf), where each zine page is a quarter of a US Letter page. This PDF, printed, can be used to produce two copies of the zine.
